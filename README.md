## Focus: Perform a exploratory project that employs machine learning (ML).


## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- pip installed (Python's package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook installed

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the folder where you'd like to save the project, and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd your-project-name
```

Create a virtual environment:

**For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**For macOS and Linux:**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

**For Windows:**

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

**For macOS and Linux:**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're also using Jupyter Notebooks, you can install the Jupyter package if it's not already listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

### 4. Execute Python Files

To run a Python script, navigate to the folder where the script is located and run:

```bash
python your-script.py
```

### 5. Run Jupyter Notebooks

If you want to run Jupyter Notebooks, navigate to the folder where the notebook is located and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with Jupyter's dashboard. Click on your notebook file (`your-notebook.ipynb`) to open it.
